Contents:
- chart.png       # (You must create this using RAWGraphs and upload it to the repository)
- README.md       # This file (contains the required email)

Instructions:
1. Open https://rawgraphs.io/ and use the "Use it now" or "Launch app" option.
2. Import the data from 'treemap_data.csv' (paste or upload).
3. Choose the 'Treemap' chart.
4. Map fields:
   - Hierarchy: drag both 'category' and 'subcategory'
   - Size: 'value'
   - Color: 'category' (optional)
   - Label: 'subcategory' (optional)
5. Customize labels, colors, and font sizes for publication quality.
6. Export as PNG with dimensions between 300x300 and 512x512 pixels and name the file 'chart.png'.
7. Create a GitHub repository and upload both README.md and chart.png to the repo root.

When the repo is ready, copy the raw URL of README.md by opening README.md on GitHub and clicking "Raw".
The raw URL will look like:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repo/main/README.md

Validation checklist for graders:
- README.md contains the email: 24ds3000049@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
- chart.png is a genuine Treemap created with RAWGraphs
- chart.png dimensions are between 300 and 512 pixels
- chart.png is uploaded to the repository root alongside README.md

Good luck! If you want, I can also give you the exact git commands to create the repo and push these files from your computer.
